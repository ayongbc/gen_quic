Notes for later:
Switching quic_parser_vx_1 to fit with current model:
- Change #quic_frame and #quic_stream records to maps (delete the quic_frame and quic_stream really)
  + Define field names alongside those in quic_conn:handle_frame/2.
  
- Change to start parsing frames instead of header as well.


Switching quic_encoder_vx_1 to fit with current model:
- Look into reverting back to using quic_frame:to_frame and then just using list_to_binary on final result.
  + Define field names alongside those in quic_conn:handle_frame/2 and parser.


Ack support:
- Look into using an orddict or gbtree.

- Need to send acks a couple times in different packets to ensure delivery as fast as possible.
  + Also cover repeat acks on receiving side.
  
- Have a separate ack_delay for each level of acks that were sent.
